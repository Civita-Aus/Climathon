This section gathers multiple sources of data of the environment of Sydney and/or Australia. 

1. [Bushfires](https://sentinel.ga.gov.au/#/) 

**Format**: Interractive map with exports options 

**What**: Bushfires locations in Australia for the past 72 hours. If you search historical data, you can select NSW and export the historical data. 


2. [SEED, Sharing and Enabling Environmental Data](https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au) 

**Format**: Data Portal 

**What**: +2,500 datasets about the environments (fauna, flora, water, etc.) in NSW. There are +300 datasets that are specific to Sydney. 


3. [NDVI maps](http://www.bom.gov.au/jsp/awap/ndvi/index.jsp)

**Format**: Interractive maps, exports available

**What**: NDVI or Normalised Difference Vegetation Index provides an overview of the status and dynamics of vegetation across Australia, providing a measure the amount of live green vegetation. See [this page](http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/austmaps/about-ndvi-maps.shtml) for more information. 


4. [State Vegetation Type in NSW](https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/vegetation/state-vegetation-type-map.htm)

**Format**: Website Page and Interractive map 

**What**: The page explains you the project (mapping the vegetation types of NSW) and redirects you to the SEED map 

5. [Water NSW - Real Time Data](https://realtimedata.waternsw.com.au/)

**Format**: Interractive Data, exports available

**What**: Precise Data of the water stream details in NSW. 

6. [Greater Sydney urban vegetation](https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/greater-sydney-region-urban-vegetation-cover-to-modified-mesh-block) 

**Format**: Interractive Map 

**What**: With this dataset, users can estimate tree canopy and vegetation cover in urban areas at many scales, such as mesh block, precinct, or local government area. Having current and accurate estimates of tree canopy and vegetation like this supports citizens and governments to reliably identify areas of tree canopy and confidently develop urban greening and heat island mitigation strategies and action.
