# 2019 Sydney Climathon
Data repository for the [2019 Sydney Climathon](https://climate-kic.org.au/climathon-2/). 

This repo compiles the multiple open datasets that will help you build a solution for the Sydney Climathon from the 25th to the 26th of October 2019. The datasets present here complement the Munich RE GIS datasets that will be available to you on the 25 and 26 of October. Because of the nature of this data, we will not release it this repo. 

Your objectives for this 24-hours hackathon is to: 
**Better identify the Sydney suburbs and locations with the greatest future exposure to the
adverse impacts of heatwaves** 
and/or 
**Develop innovative data-driven solutions to improve Sydneyâ€™s resilience to these adverse
impacts, such as preventative services (e.g. retro-fitting), early detection and warning
systems, severity reduction tools, response optimisation and recovery management
solutions.**	
		
**What is a heatwave?**

Heatwaves can be notoriously tricky to define. For the purposes of the Climathon we define them as "at least three consecutive days where the daily maximum temperature is in the top 10 percent of warmest temperatures for that calendar date". See the fantastic resource [Scorcher](scorcher.org.au/about) for more information.

**What is the Urban Islan Heat Effect?** 
"*This is due to factors such as buildings that block
wind, the use of dark-coloured paving or asphalt, heat generated by vehicles, air
conditioners and industrial facilities, and a lack of vegetation to cool parts of a
city. The effects of urban heat islands are often worse in the densest parts of the
city with the fewest greenspaces. This may include central business districts,
informal settlements and other areas with high population density.15 Research
indicates that in cities with wet climates, urban heat island impacts are further
compounded by high humidity in the air leading to a heightened impact on
human health.16 Other factors like higher concentrations of air pollution in urban
areas can also aggravate the human health impact of extreme heat in cities.*"


You will find in this repository a range of resources (open datasets, reports, etc.) to help you buid the best well-informed data-centric solution for the Climathon. Each impact type described below has its own folder. The folder includes data sources, the format type and a brief description of what it contains. We also added a "Maps" section for you to use and present geospatial information. Finally, there is a "Climate" section with data and reports about the Climate, Climate changes and heatwaves. 


**Types of Impacts** 

**People** 
    
A. Health issues: dehydration, heat exhaustion, heat stroke, death
      
B. Populations at risks: Elderly, infants, outdoor workers
      
C. Need for emergency services: emergency services readiness and capacity 
      
**Infrastructures** 
    
C. Road surface melting 

D. Public transport infrastructure failure, e.g.train lines buckling

E. Electricity infrastructure performance and failure

**Services** 
    
F. Electricity consumption and supplies
      
G. Water consumption and supplies
      
    
 **Environment** 
    
H. Reduced Crop yields due to damage to plants reproductive parts
      
I. Livestock stress and deatch
      
J. Mass death of temperature sensitive animals
      
K. Coral Bleaching and damage to marine ecosystems

      
**Economy** 
    
L. Productivity decrease 
    
M. Healthcare costs & insurance premiums increase
    
N. Sporting events, e.g. the [2014 Australian Open](https://theconversation.com/a-year-of-records-the-human-role-in-2014s-wild-weather-50208)
    
O. Tourism
